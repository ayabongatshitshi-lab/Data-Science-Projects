**SMS Spam Classifier**



This project builds a deep learning model using text vectorization and neural network layers to classify SMS messages as either “ham” (normal/1) or “spam” (advertisement/0). Using the SMS Spam Collection dataset (hosted in freecodecamp's website), the model is trained on labelled messages and evaluated on test data. A function predict\_message returns the likelihood of a message being ham or spam, along with the predicted label.
