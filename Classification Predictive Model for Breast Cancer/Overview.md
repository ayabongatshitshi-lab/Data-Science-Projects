1. The project begins with theoretical questions on some machine learning fundamental concepts and model robustness to data quality issues - addressed in the "Introduction to ML Assignment 1";



2\. Then explores predictive models to predict breast tumours as malignant (M) or benign (B). A decision tree and KNN model sre developed and compared based on predictive performance with unseen data.
The target feature is diagnosis. The dataset contains the following descriptive features:

* id
* diagnosis
* radius\_mean
* texture\_mean
* perimeter\_mean
* area\_mean
* smoothness\_mean
* compactness\_mean
* concavity\_mean
* concave points\_mean
* symmetry\_mean
* fractal\_dimension\_mean
* radius\_se
* texture\_se
* perimeter\_se
* area\_se
* smoothness\_se
* compactness\_se
* concavity\_se
* concave points\_se
* symmetry\_se
* fractal\_dimension\_se
* radius\_worst
* texture\_worst
* perimeter\_worst
* area\_worst
* smoothness\_worst
* compactness\_worst
* concavity\_worst
* concave points\_worst
* symmetry\_worst,
* fractal\_dimension\_worst
* gender
* Bratio.

These features provide quantitative measurements that can be used to assess the characteristics of cell nuclei and aid in distinguishing between malignant and benign breast masses. By training a machine learning model on this dataset, it is possible to develop a predictive model that can assist in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.
Provided are two datasets, i.e. the trainingset (breastCancerTrain.csv) containing 390 instances and the test set (breastCancerTest.csv) containing 179 instances.
