**Sea Level Predictor**

This project analyzes global average sea level changes since 1880 and predicts sea level rise through 2050. Using a dataset of historical measurements, the project creates scatter plots and fits linear regression lines using scipy.stats.linregress to estimate trends. 
Two lines of best fit are plotted: one using all data since 1880, and one using data from 2000 onward, providing predictions based on both long-term and recent trends.
